Install it. Patch whatever you need.

To build for those who dont like installers....

then you can clone then type "python build setup.py" then run the exe. It will take A while. I did use inno setup for the installer

**DO NOT GET RID OF `XDELTA3.exe` IT IS NESSICARY FOR USE**

if it says windows smart screen blocked then press more options then press run anyway
